# Test Writer

Write the contract in code. Prove it fails. Lock it down.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write implementation code — no route handlers, service methods, adapters,
or business logic. test-writer produces test files only. If you are writing code
that makes a test pass, you are in the wrong skill — that is build's job.
The structural separation between test authoring and implementation is what
prevents the #1 AI testing failure: modifying tests to match the code.
</HARD-GATE>

<HARD-GATE>
Every test MUST trace to a user-validated contract from test-planning. Do NOT
invent test scenarios, assertions, or expected values from your understanding
of the code. If the test-planning contract doesn't specify an error case, ask
— don't fill the gap yourself. The user validated the contracts because they
know what "correct" means for their system. You don't.
</HARD-GATE>

<HARD-GATE>
NEVER modify a test that has been committed — not the assertions, not the
expected values, not the test logic, not even "just a small fix." If a test
appears wrong during build, the test-writer's job is done — escalate to the
user or back to test-planning. Tests are contracts, not suggestions. Once
committed, they define "done" and only the user can change that definition.
</HARD-GATE>

<HARD-GATE>
Every test MUST fail before committing. Run the test suite and confirm each
new test fails for the RIGHT reason — "not found," "not implemented," or
"no such method." If a test fails because of broken test infrastructure
("connection refused," "module not found"), fix the infrastructure first.
If a test passes immediately, the feature already exists or the test is
wrong — investigate before proceeding.
</HARD-GATE>

## Method Selection

Different contracts produce different test types. Integration tests are always the starting point.

| Contract Type | Test Type | Priority |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| API endpoint behavior (status, response shape) | Integration test through real HTTP | Write first — highest confidence |
| Error/failure scenarios (network error, invalid input) | Integration test with mock at boundary | Write alongside happy path — not optional |
| Data transformation or business logic | Unit test if logic is complex and isolated | Write after integration tests |
| Cross-service workflow | E2E test | Write sparingly — only critical user journeys |

**Default to integration.** Unit tests only when the contract explicitly calls for isolated logic testing or when build adds them during implementation.

## Process

### 0. Check Prerequisites

Before writing any test code:
- [ ] Test plan exists with user-validated contracts (from **test-planning**)
- [ ] Test infrastructure is ready (database, test runner, any required mock servers)
- [ ] Existing test patterns in the codebase have been read (match conventions)
- [ ] If greenfield: a walking skeleton test exists and passes

If prerequisites are missing, stop. Don't improvise — go back to test-planning.

### 1. Pick the Next Vertical

Work one vertical at a time, in dependency order from the test plan. Do not write tests for multiple verticals in one pass. Report which vertical you're working on.

### 2. Read the Contract

Read the test-planning contract for this vertical. Identify:
- **Setup** — what state must exist before the test
- **Action** — the API call or operation
- **Input** — request body, parameters, headers
- **Expected output** — response status, body shape, key fields
- **Side effects** — database changes, events emitted, external calls made
- **Error cases** — what happens with bad input, missing deps, failure scenarios

Each of these maps directly to a test.

### 3. Read Existing Test Patterns

Before writing new tests, read existing test files in the project. Match:
- File naming convention (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)
- Import patterns (test utilities, helpers, factories)
- Setup/teardown patterns (how the project handles DB cleanup)
- Assertion style (what expect/assert patterns are used)

Write tests that look like they belong in this codebase. Consistency matters.

### 4. Write the Integration Test (AAA)

Structure every test as **Arrange-Act-Assert**. AAA makes test failures self-diagnosing: the Arrange shows what state existed, the Act shows what happened, and the Assert shows what was expected vs. actual. A reader debugging a failure at 2 AM needs this structure.

```typescript
describe('Token refresh with network error', () => {
  it('When refresh fails with network error, Then credential stays active and returns 503', async () => {
    // Arrange — set up the preconditions from the contract
    const store = new SqliteTokenStore(testDbPath);
    await storeTestCredential(store, 'user-1', 'google', expiredTokenSet);
    const mockFetch = async () => { throw new TypeError('fetch failed'); };

    // Act — perform the operation under test
    const res = await app.request('/credentials/user-1/google');

    // Assert — verify the contract's expected output and side effects
    expect(res.status).toBe(503);
    const body = await res.json();
    expect(body.error).toBe('temporarily_unavailable');

    // Assert side effects — credential status unchanged
    const cred = await store.getCredential('user-1', 'google');
    expect(cred.status).toBe('active');
  });
});
```

### 5. Write Error Case Tests

Error cases are first-class. They are not "nice to have" — they catch the bugs that wake people up at night.

For every error case in the contract, write a separate test with the same AAA structure. The Arrange phase sets up the failure condition. The Assert phase verifies the system handles it correctly.

Common error categories to cover from contracts:
- **Invalid input** — missing fields, wrong types, malformed data
- **Missing dependencies** — resource not found, service unavailable
- **External failures** — network errors, timeout, provider returns error
- **Authorization failures** — wrong credentials, expired tokens, insufficient permissions
- **Boundary conditions** — empty collections, max limits, concurrent requests

### 6. Confirm Red

Run the test suite. Every new test must fail. Check each failure:

| Failure Reason | Status | Action |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| "Not found" / "not implemented" / 404 | Correct — feature doesn't exist yet | Proceed to commit |
| "Connection refused" / "module not found" | Wrong — test infrastructure broken | Fix infrastructure, re-run |
| Test passes | Wrong — feature already exists or test is broken | Investigate before proceeding |
| Assertion error with unexpected values | Wrong — test may have incorrect expectations | Check against contract, ask user if unclear |

### 7. Commit

Commit the test file(s) for this vertical with a clear message:

```
test(scope): V1 integration tests — [slice name]
```

These committed tests are now locked artifacts. Build will implement against them.

### 8. Report and Next Vertical

Report status: "V1 tests written and committed (red). [N] integration tests, [M] error case tests."

Move to the next vertical. Repeat from step 1.

## Mock Boundary Rules

The mock boundary determines what is real and what is faked in tests. Getting this wrong is the most common source of false confidence.

| Dependency | Mock? | WHY |
|------------|-------|-----|
| **Your database** | No — use real instance | Mocking your own DB hides the bugs that hurt most: schema mismatches, constraint violations, query errors |
| **Your server/API** | No — use real instance | Testing through the real API catches routing, middleware, serialization bugs |
| **Your file system** | No — use real (temp dirs) | File system bugs are real bugs |
| **Third-party APIs** (OAuth providers, payment processors) | Yes — mock at adapter boundary | You can't control their uptime, rate limits, or response changes. Mock what you send, not what they do. |
| **External services** (email, SMS, webhooks) | Yes — mock at adapter boundary | Prevent side effects. Verify you send the right request. |

**Never use in-memory substitutes** for production infrastructure. Don't use SQLite for Postgres. Don't use a fake Redis. Test against the same type and version as production.

### Three Mock Types

Not all mocks are equal. Know which you're using and why.

| Mock Type | Purpose | Verdict | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Isolation** | Keep external systems out, verify outgoing requests | Good | Mock the OAuth token endpoint, verify correct client_id is sent |
| **Simulation** | Force a scenario you can't trigger via inputs | Acceptable | Mock `fetch` to throw `TypeError('fetch failed')` for network error test |
| **Implementation** | Check that internal code ran a certain way | Avoid | Assert that `logger.info` was called exactly 3 times |

**The formula for a bad mock:** It applies to *internal* code AND it appears in the *assert* phase. If you're asserting on how internal functions were called, you're testing implementation, not behavior.

When mocking external APIs, don't just verify the call was made — **verify the request body, headers, and URL**. "Ensuring an HTTP call was made to the right URL is not enough — verify the body contains necessary fields."

## Test Naming Convention

Test names are documentation. When a test fails in CI at 2 AM, the name alone should tell you what broke.

**Pattern:** `When [condition], Then [expected outcome]`

```
Good: 'When token refresh fails with network error, Then credential stays active and returns 503'
Good: 'When user submits order with empty cart, Then returns 400 with validation error'
Good: 'When OAuth provider returns invalid_grant, Then credential marked needs_reauth'

Bad:  'test refresh error handling'
Bad:  'should work correctly'
Bad:  'error test'
```

**For describe blocks**, name the component or feature under test:

```typescript
describe('GET /credentials/:userId/:provider', () => {
  describe('When credential requires token refresh', () => {
    it('Then refreshes token and returns fresh env vars', ...);
    it('When refresh fails with network error, Then returns 503 and keeps credential active', ...);
    it('When refresh fails with invalid_grant, Then returns 401 and marks needs_reauth', ...);
  });
});
```

## Test Isolation

Every test must be independent. No test should depend on state from another test.

**Rules:**
- Each test creates its own data in the Arrange phase
- Tests must pass in any order
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for cleanup, not beforeAll (state leaks between tests)
- If using a database: fresh instance per suite or truncate per test

**Read the project's existing isolation pattern** before writing new tests. Match it.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | What Happens | This Skill Prevents It By |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Modify test to pass** | AI changes assertions to match buggy code | Structural separation — test-writer commits before build starts |
| **Improvised contracts** | Tests validate assumed behavior, not specified behavior | Hard gate — every test traces to test-planning contract |
| **Happy path only** | Error cases untested, failures crash production | Error cases are first-class in the process, not optional |
| **Over-mocking** | Mock internal systems, tests pass but code is broken | Mock boundary table — only uncontrolled deps get mocked |
| **Implementation mocks** | Assert on internal function calls, tests break on refactor | Three mock types guide — avoid mocks in assert phase on internal code |
| **Test passes immediately** | Test doesn't actually test anything | Confirm red gate — every test must fail before commit |
| **Brittle assertions** | Test breaks on irrelevant changes (timestamps, IDs) | Assert on behavior and contract fields, not exact object equality |

Follow the communication-protocol skill for all user-facing output and interaction.

## Guidelines

- **Tests are contracts, not suggestions.** Once committed, they define "done." Build implements against them. If they seem wrong, escalate — don't adjust.
- **Integration first, always.** Integration tests catch 99% of bugs with less effort than comprehensive unit coverage. Start here for every vertical.
- **Error paths are first-class.** They catch the bugs that wake people up at night. Not optional, not "if time allows."
- **Match the codebase.** Read existing tests before writing new ones. Consistency in style, naming, and patterns makes the test suite maintainable.
- **AAA is non-negotiable.** Every test: Arrange (set up state), Act (do the thing), Assert (check the result). No exceptions.
- **Mock at the boundary, nowhere else.** Your database is not the enemy. Third-party APIs are.
- **One vertical at a time.** Write, confirm red, commit. Then next. Don't batch.
